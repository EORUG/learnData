"[{\"text\":\"Hi! I'm a bit newer here and got my first subscription opened today using the docs üôÇ \\n\\nHad a quick Qs based on some confusion I had with nomenclature in the docs\\n\\nI was wondering the difference between `newTxs` and `pendingTxs`. Would `newTxs` be transactions that have entered the mempool, and `pendingTxs` are ones that have been included in the next proposed block as its being mined? Thanks!\\n\\nAlso is there any way to get logs from these transactions? i.e. I can get the tx data sent to a universal router, but I cant get the actual transfers since they are emitted as events / or maybe internal transcations?\",\"id\":\"1184800711112933417\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638411171233398824/1184800711112933417\",\"userId\":\"213172021578694661\",\"date\":1702548902062},{\"text\":\"Hello <@213172021578694661>! Both streams offer transactions that have entered the mempool and have not yet been included in a block. However, we do recommend using newTxs feed for better/faster performance. As far as getting logs we do have the internalTxsMempool stream which offers what you're looking for.
