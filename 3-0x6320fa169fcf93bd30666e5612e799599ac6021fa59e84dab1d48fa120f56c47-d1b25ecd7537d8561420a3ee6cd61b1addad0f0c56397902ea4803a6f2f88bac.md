However, I have a program running that sometimes calls the `blxr_submit_bundle` endpoint. It gave me the error above twice. Once at 7:28PM UTC and once at 7:45PM UTC (without any successful calls in between I believe). Then at 7:50PM UTC I confirmed manually with the `curl` above that it was not working. The manual `curl` was from a different system than the automated calls. The only thing they had in common was my authorization header.\\n\\nHowever if it was based on the authorization header it should not have lead to a connection error/timeout like this but rather given some error code. IDK if anyone else can confirm but I would guess that during this time (~half an hour that I noticed, could be more) it was down for everyone. At least the previous times I had this error there were also other people in here with the same issue.\",\"id\":\"1202441472662577194\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638411171233398824/1202441472662577194\",\"userId\":\"185415841049870338\",\"date\":1706754787365,\"replyTo\":\"1202372205707534397\"},{\"text\":\"I saw that we had a service outage around that time, can you dm me with your account details, I will confirm it was during that time.\",\"id\":\"1202619804310315068\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638411171233398824/1202619804310315068\",\"userId\":\"950472962040021013\",\"date\":1706797304943,\"replyTo\":\"1202441472662577194\"}]"
