Let me show you the whole message from Maestro that might clear up my confusion. They state \\\"Faster Private Transactions,\\\" so the way they are wording it makes it seem like private transactions through bloXroute are always faster than public transactions. Which doesn't seem like it should be possible. Is it possible for bloXroute private transactions to be mined before a public transaction? Or is there still a delay similar to other Anti-MEV providers (other than the 400-1000ms faster transaction propogation)?\\n> 🌟  Maestro Feature Update  🌟\\n> \\n> Anti-MEV has become an essential tool for ETH traders, and it's about time we pushed it to its absolute limits.
