I sent a transaction to gateway/Cloud-API and received a tx hash as response, but I couldn't find it on a block explorer (e.g. etherscan). How to troubleshoot? \\nThe BDN doesn't perform the same detail of transaction validation that the nodes (e.g. Geth) do. Your transaction may have passed the basic validations (e.g. checksums and other sanity checks) but may not be accepted by the TxPool. Common errors include incorrect sender nonce and low sender balance. We recommend sending the transaction to a node (personal node or public RPC endpoint), which usually gives a more descriptive error message.`\",\"id\":\"1199098863768829992\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638411171233398824/1199098863768829992\",\"userId\":\"945399314539216917\",\"date\":1705957847302,\"replyTo\":\"1199097126437797958\"},{\"text\":\"some providers such as flashbots or mevblocker got a limnk where you can check your tx, and you can check things such as submitted time and a few basic data\",\"id\":\"1199117267984719942\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638411171233398824/1199117267984719942\",\"userId\":\"1142155800069025853\",\"date\":1705962235209,\"replyTo\":\"1199098863768829992\"},{\"text\":\"You might want to try https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/tx-validation\",\"id\":\"1199118172930977812\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638411171233398824/1199118172930977812\",\"userId\":\"945399314539216917\",\"date\":1705962450965,\"replyTo\":\"1199117267984719942\"},{\"text\":\"thank you!\",\"id\":\"1199148128088100924\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638411171233398824/1199148128088100924\",\"userId\":\"1142155800069025853\",\"date\":1705969592831,\"replyTo\":\"1199118172930977812\"}]"
