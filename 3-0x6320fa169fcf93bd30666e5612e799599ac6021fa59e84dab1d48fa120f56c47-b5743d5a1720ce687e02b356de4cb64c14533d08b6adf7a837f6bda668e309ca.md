"[{\"text\":\"Hello, Team!\\n\\nWe have a task: we need to send two transactions, each signed by a different address in the blockchain. Both addresses are under our control. We need these transactions to be mined in a specific order: first, Transaction 1 (TX1) from Sender A, and then Transaction 2 (TX2) from Sender B, ensuring that there are no other transactions in between them. Could you please advise on the best technical approach to achieve this?\\n\\nThank you.\",\"id\":\"1189975973970583682\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638409433860407302/1189975973970583682\",\"userId\":\"833610770587320350\",\"date\":1703782780879},{\"text\":\"We are operating in BSC network if this matters\",\"id\":\"1189976080887582842\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638409433860407302/1189976080887582842\",\"userId\":\"833610770587320350\",\"date\":1703782806370},{\"text\":\"Hello <@833610770587320350> ! You would need to use a MEV bundle in order to achieve this. The txs in a bundle are atomically ordered so they should land on chain in the order you arrange them. We offer MEV services for both ETH and BSC you can take a look at our docs for BSC here https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/mev-solution/bsc-bundle-submission\\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions!\",\"id\":\"1189977336943214692\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638409433860407302/1189977336943214692\",\"userId\":\"945399314539216917\",\"date\":1703783105837,\"replyTo\":\"1189975973970583682\"},{\"text\":\"happy new years\",\"id\":\"1191115695191248916\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638409433860407302/1191115695191248916\",\"userId\":\"1157735745352630413\",\"date\":1704054511593},{\"text\":\"I need to do the same but for polygon also this transaction will be private ?\",\"id\":\"1191421967530741790\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638409433860407302/1191421967530741790\",\"userId\":\"492372511200247809\",\"date\":1704127532609,\"replyTo\":\"1189977336943214692\"}]"
