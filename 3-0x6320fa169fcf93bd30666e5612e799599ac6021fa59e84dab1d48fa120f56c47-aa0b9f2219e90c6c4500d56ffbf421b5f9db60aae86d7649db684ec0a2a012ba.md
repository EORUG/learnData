"[{\"text\":\"Hi, I have a question: I am using `polygon_private_tx` endpoint, but I get `reached Enterprise tier rate limit of 3 private tx submission per 1s` error even though I submit only two txs at a time. However, at the same time I also use `blxr_batch_tx` endpoint with `validators_only=True` parameter. Is there a possibility of interference between those two endpoints that causes this error?\",\"id\":\"1204415215530414100\",\"url\":\"https://discord.com/channels/638409433860407300/638411171233398824/1204415215530414100\",\"userId\":\"813150293340323891\",\"date\":1707225364335},{\"text\":\"another question is: why I don't see a declared difference in the delay of appearance in the public mempool (In a recent benchmark of this feature, we observed 300-700ms delays before the validators_only transactions became public.) https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/sending-transactions/semi-private-transaction ?
